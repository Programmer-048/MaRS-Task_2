# MaRS-Task_2

Tought Process:
As the Communication System Subsystem Task was given to us, I had to build an RF Communication System sending over the distance data collected from the UltraSound sensor.
I have used this oppourtinity to try and create, establish a data communication using RF Module.

Steps:
1. I first established the communication by writting the Receiver and Transmitter codes and sending 'Hello World' string.
2. Then I wrote the code for reading data from Ultrasound sensor.
3. I integrated it by sending the received data to Receiver through Transmitter.
